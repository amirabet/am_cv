# HTML5 Resume

## Motivation

**This project arises from the need to have a resume ready to share easily and immediately.
So I decided that the best idea was to layout it in HTLM5 format and make it publicly available using GitHub Pages.
This led me to work in a responsive format, where two columns would be displayed whenever the screen supported it (tablet format).
At the same time, and most importantly, I wanted to have a printable format that would fit the desired content on a single page.**

The main requirements for this project were:
- Simple and print friendly format.
- Easy to update.
- Avoid the use of images.
- The content for printing should be able to fit in a DINa4.

## Going beyond
Once a good layout was achieved, the next step was to add some animation in order to make the presentation more attractive and take advantage of the interactive HTML medium.
However, I chose to do something simple and uncluttered, following the minimalist aesthetics of the document, and avoiding the use of JS.
There is also no use of Javascript in the Modal for printing: only CSS is used.

## Further improvements
Whenever you get into a project, opportunities for improvement appear ad-infinitum.
Right now, areas where the project could advance would be:
- Microformats, following this excellent tutorial from
- Make the dynamic content and translation easier using some HTML generator.
- Convert the CSS to SCSS and offer a minified version.
- Prepare some color version, configurable, for screen formats.
- And many more...
