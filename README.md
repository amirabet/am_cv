# HTML5 Resume - Modern Professional CV

## Motivation

**This project arises from the need to have a resume ready to share easily and immediately.
So I decided that the best idea was to layout it in HTML5 format and make it publicly available using GitHub Pages.
This led me to work in a responsive format, where two columns would be displayed whenever the screen supported it (tablet format).
At the same time, and most importantly, I wanted to have a printable format that would fit the desired content on a single page.**

The main requirements for this project were:

- Simple and print friendly format.
- Easy to update.
- Avoid the use of images.
- The content for printing should be able to fit in a DIN A4.

## Going beyond

Once a good layout was achieved, the next step was to add some animation in order to make the presentation more attractive and take advantage of the interactive HTML medium.
However, I chose to do something simple and uncluttered, following the minimalist aesthetics of the document, and avoiding excessive use of JS.
The Modal for printing uses primarily CSS with minimal JavaScript enhancement.
